	<h6>SPEED BREAKER</h6>

	<div class="grid">
        <p>A large amount of energy is wasted at the speed breakers through friction , every time a vehicle passes over it.So electricity can be generated using the vehicle weight (potential energy) as input.So,this is a small step to try to improve this situation.</p>

		 	   <h2>1.Motor (300rpm,12V)</h2>
			   <img src="images/motor.jpg">
		 	   <p>These motors are simple DC Motors featuring gears for the shaft for obtaining the optimal performance characteristics. They are known as Center Shaft DC Geared Motors because their shaft extends through the center of their gearbox assembly.This DC Motor – 300 RPM – 12 Volts can be used in all-terrain robots and a variety of robotic applications. These motors have a 3 mm threaded drill hole in the middle of the shaft thus making it simple to connect it to the wheels or any other mechanical assembly.
Nut and threads on the shaft to easily connect and internally threaded shaft for easily connecting it to the wheels.
These DC Geared motors with robust metal/Plastic gearbox for heavy-duty applications</p>
		 	  
			   <h2>2.White small tyre</h2>
			   <img src="images/tyre.jpg">
		 	   <p>We used this small tyre to fix the motor of one side and another side which helps to reduce friction.Thus it helps the rotations of speed breaker to be fast. </p>
		 	  
			   <h2>3.LED BULBS and WIRES</h2>
			   <img src="images/bulb.jpg">
		 	   <p>A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that produces light from electricity. LEDs last a long time and do not break easily (compared to incandescent lightbulbs).They can produce many different colours. They are efficient - most of the energy turns into light, not heat</p>
	 		  
			   <h2>WORKING</h2>
		 	   <p>Electricity is generated by replacing the traditional speed breakers with some simple mechanism. As vehicle passes over it, it starts moving. A chain drive mechanism is provided which transfer the motion to a DC motor/generator for electricity generation.. This method is an effective way to produce electricity as the numbers of vehicles on the road are ever increasing. Also the cost of fabrication of the model is low. It can be effectively placed near traffic lights, at the entrance of parking lots and any other place where the traffic density is high. Rollers are fixed on a wooden ramp on which vehicle passes.  This method provides an efficient way to generate electricity from the kinetic energy of moving vehicles in roads, highways, parking lots etc.</p><br>
