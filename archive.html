              <h2>1.REVOLVING DOOR</h2>
	      <img src="images/door.jpg">

              <p>The revolving door structure consists of individual door panels (or wings), a canter shaft with the hardware needed to support the door wings, above the door one hand is attached to the shaft this hand will be using for rotating the doors.</p><br>
	
	      <h2>2.MAGNETO (MOTOR)</h2>	
	      <img src="images/motor1.jpg">
	      <p>A magneto is an electrical generator that uses permanent magnets to produce periodic pulses of alternating current. Unlike a dynamo, a magneto does not contain a commutator to produce direct current. It is categorized as a form of alternator, although it is usually considered distinct from most other alternators, which use field coils rather than permanent magnets. 
Magnetos adapted to produce impulses of high voltage for spark plugs are used in the ignition systems of spark-ignition piston engines. producing alternating current as opposed to the direct current.</p><br>

	      <h2>3.STEPPER MOTOR</h2>
	      <img src="images/motor2.jpg">
	      <p>A stepper motor, also known as step motor or stepping motor, is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. The motor's position can then be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any position sensor for feedback (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor is carefully sized to the application in respect to torque and speed.
Computer controlled stepper motors are a type of motion-control positioning system. They are typically digitally controlled as part of an open loop system for use in holding or positioning applications. In this model step motor is used like generator.</p><br>

	      <h2>4.PULLY</h2>
	      <img src="images/pully.jpg">
	      <p>Here we used 2 pulleys. One is called larger that is called driver and another one is smaller that is called driven(follower). When we rotate the door that is directly connected to larger pulley, it will also rotate as the door rotates. So, from the larger the power is transmitted to smaller one that is connected to motor. The power transmitted from one shaft to another shaft by belts or ropes run over the pulley.</p><br>

	      <h2>1.Diode</h2>
	      <img src="images/diode.jpg"><br>
	      <p>A diode is a semiconductor device that essentially acts as a one-way switch for current. It allows current to flow easily in one direction, but severely restricts current from flowing in the opposite direction.</p><br>

	      <h2>2.capacitor</h2>
	      <img src="images/capacitor.jpg">
	      <p>The capacitor is a component which has the ability or “capacity” to store energy in the form of an electrical charge producing a potential difference (Static Voltage) across its plates, much like a small rechargeable battery.</p><br>

	      <h2>3.Resistor</h2>
	      <img src="images/resistor.jpg">
	      <p>A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.</p><br>

	      <h2>4.Zener Diode</h2>
	      <img src="images/zener.jpg">
	      <p>A Zener diode is a type of diode that allows current to flow in the conventional manner - from its anode to its cathode i.e. when the anode is positive with respect to the cathode. When the voltage across the terminals is reversed and the potential reaches the Zener voltage (or "knee"), the junction will break down and current will flow in the reverse direction - a desired characteristic. Zener diodes have a highly doped p–n junction. A similar break down is observed in general purpose diodes (which might be quite high, but the voltage and sharpness of the knee is not clearly defined as in Zener diodes.</p><br>

	<h2>WORKING</h2>
	      <p>When door is rotating then motor gets paralelly rotated and generates the energy. Motor initially connected with the bridge rectifier (Collection of diodes connected with bridge like structure). When the power passes through the rectifier,at tthat point of time AC current will be converted into the DC. During power generation some current fluctuation happens and it will be controlled by capacitor by handling the power. Resister and Zener diode will maintain the voltage of the current(5V) to avoid the damages. The power generated will be passed to the mobile through the USB connectivity. Whenever the user rotates door then energy gets generated and that energy will be used to charge the mobile. And  generated power can also be stored in the no.  of  batteries.</p>
